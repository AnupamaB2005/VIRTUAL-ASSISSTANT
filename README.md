# VIRTUAL-ASSISSTANT
I created a virtual assistant using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that takes voice input, answers user queries, and opens apps like Google or YouTube. It uses the Web Speech API for speech recognition and provides features like current time, date, or custom responses, offering a responsive and interactive user experience.
